Tutorial by Indrek Lasn, displaying NASA's astronomy picture of the day with React-Redux.

I really liked this tutorial, as both an astronomy geek and someone solidifying my knowledge of react and redux.

I found the example to be useful in highlighting the steps of wiring up a simple app as well as certain conventions like using the spread operator to pass state to a new array with the data from the API.

This is my third go at a react-redux app and I'm pleased with the results. I plan on adding some input functionality to practice the flow of data from a user action to render a new state. Stay tuned!
